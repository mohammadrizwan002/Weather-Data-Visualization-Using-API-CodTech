Task 1 – Weather Data Visualization using API

Objective
The goal of this task is to fetch weather forecast data from a public API and visualize the temperature trends using Python. This project uses the OpenWeatherMap API to collect data and Matplotlib to create a line chart showing forecasted temperatures.

Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- OpenWeatherMap API
- Matplotlib
- Requests
- Google Colab

Files Included
- `Task1_Weather_Visualization.ipynb` – Python notebook containing the complete code
- `output_chart.png` – Line chart image showing temperature trends
- `README.md` – This file

 How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Run all the cells without modification. The API key is already included.
3. The output chart will display and also be saved as `output_chart.png`.

Output
The project generates a line chart showing the hourly temperature forecast for the selected city. It uses clean visualization with proper labels, legends, and layout.
